# Our predict_weather method should output a message indicating whether a sunny or cloudy day lies ahead. However, the output is the same every time the method is invoked. Why? Fix the code so that it behaves as expected.

# You want to have a small script delivering motivational quotes, but with the following code you run into a very common error message: no implicit conversion of nil into String (TypeError). What is the problem and how can you fix it?

# def get_quote(person)
#   if person == 'Yoda'
#     'Do. Or do not. There is no try.'
#   elsif person == 'Confucius'
#     'I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.'
#   elsif person == 'Einstein'
#     'Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.'
#   end
# end

# puts 'Confucius says:'
# puts '"' + get_quote('Confucius') + '"'
# puts get_quote('Confucius')
# or:
# def get_quote(person)
#   if person == 'Yoda'
#     return 'Do. Or do not. There is no try.'
#   end

#   if person == 'Confucius'
#     return 'I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.'

#   if person == 'Einstein'
#     return 'Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.'
#   end

# Since our original code did not have an explicit return statement, the return value is the evaluated result of the last line executed. The last line is an if statement, which returns the evaluated result of the branch whose condition evaluates as true, or nil if there is no such branch. When we passed 'Confucius' or 'Yoda' in as the argument, the condition person == 'Einstein' evaluated to false, so the last if statement evaluated to nil. This caused our original method to return nil every time an argument other than 'Einstein' is passed in.
